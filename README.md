## ❗ Consumer Warning

While Xera is safer and more secure than its predecessor, MOFHY-Lite, it has not yet been fully cleared by the community, and is not yet recomended to be used in a production or public envirement. If you do decided to use this software publically, you claim full responsability, and release mahtab2003 and all maintainers from any legal action.

We invite you to search for vulnerabilities amd report them (Or better yet, fix them and make a pull request), so we can have a safe and secure MOFH client area for all!
